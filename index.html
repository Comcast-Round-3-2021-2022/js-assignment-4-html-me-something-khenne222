      <p>Growing up, I remember always having a garden.  
         My mother and I would grow things like strawberries, peppers, tomatos, 
         and whatever else we could get out hands on that happened to be in a seed
         packet.  Little did I know that my childhood pastime would become my favorite
         hobby in adulthood.</p>

   <section><p>I started my current plant collection in college with an inherited aloe
      plant that I received from a friend.  Barb, the friend in question, mentioned
      to me that this particular plant she had been tending to for over 30 years, 
      and could no longer keep up with the volume of babies it was producing.
      I never knew plants "had babies", and started digging deeper into what I now 
      know as propigation. TEST

      <p>As I learned more and more, my collection grew.  
         I started swapping cuttings and pups with people I'd meet
          pretty much anywhere I met.  Anyone
      with even a mention of having a collection of plants was a potential 
      future prop buddy.

   <section><p>Eventually I started running into difficulties with some of the plants
      I had collected and began to educate myself about better care techniques.  
      This lack of information resulted in a bunch of dead or poorly maintained
      plants - and, obviously, a lot of dead or decaying projects.  Luckily
      with the help of the internet and some amazing advice from more tenured
      plant people, I've grown not only the specimines that I've collected, but also
      have propogated severl hundreds of cuttings and pups that I've gifted and
      traded through the years.</p>

   <section><p>Some of my favorite plants in my collection include pothos, monstera, 
      succulents, garden variety fruits and veg, and recently I've delved into
      the world of carniverous plants.  I have a thriving jug plant that I'm extremely
      proud of, which just this season produced its first ever functioning pitchers!  
      The pitchers gather water, which it uses to trap and eventually break down
      small insects for food.</p>
